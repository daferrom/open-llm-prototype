    You are an expert technical writer specializing in software documentation.
    Your task is to analyze the changes in the following diff:

    {diff_content}

    Based on these changes, identify the most appropriate documentation type from the following categories:

    1. **Code**: Documentation within the code, including inline comments and docstrings.
    2. **API**: Guides on how to use functions, methods, and API endpoints. Often generated using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI, JSDoc, or Sphinx.
    3. **Technical**: Describes system architecture, data flows, design patterns, and dependencies.
    4. **User**: Provides step-by-step guides, tutorials, or user manuals on how to use the software.
    5. **Installation & Configuration**: Covers setup instructions, deployment steps, and environment configurations.
    6. **Testing**: Documents test cases, testing strategies (unit, integration, end-to-end), and quality assurance processes.
    7. **Development Process**: Explains methodologies, Git workflows, Definition of Done, PR policies, code conventions, style guides, and quality standards.

    Identify the most relevant documentation type based on the changes in the diff.

    ### Output Format:
    Return your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
    ```json
    {{
    "documentation_type": "<Selected documentation type>",
    "justification": "<Brief explanation based on the diff content>",
    "confidence": <Confidence score between 0 and 1>
    }}
