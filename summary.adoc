== Summary of Modifications

=== New Script: `get_diff.py`
- A new file `src/scripts/get_diff.py` has been added to the codebase.
- This script provides functionality for generating a `.diff` file containing changes made in the most recent Git commit.

== Description of Changes

1. **New Functionality:**
   - A new Python function, `get_git_diff()`, has been implemented:
     - **Purpose:** Fetches the `.diff` output for the last Git commit.
     - **Implementation:** Utilizes the `subprocess.run()` function to execute the `git diff HEAD^` command.
       - Parameters: 
         - `capture_output=True`: Captures the standard output and standard error.
         - `text=True`: Ensures the captured output is returned as a string rather than bytes.
       - Returns: A string containing the `.diff` output from the last commit.
   - This function adds convenience for programmatically fetching Git diff details.

2. **File I/O Operations:**
   - The script writes the diff data retrieved by `get_git_diff()` to a file named `diff.txt`:
     - A file object is opened in write mode using the `with open()` syntax for safer file handling.
     - The diff content is written to the file.

3. **Execution Logic:**
   - The script includes a main script block (`if __name__ == "__main__"`):
     - Executes the `get_git_diff()` function.
     - Writes the diff output to the file.
     - Prints a message to the console, `Changes Detected on diff.txt`, indicating successful operation.

== Impact Analysis

1. **New Features:**
   - Enables automated generation of Git diff reports, which could be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for tracking code changes or generating changelogs.

2. **No Backward Compatibility Issues:**
   - Since this file is newly added and does not replace or modify existing functionality, there are no backward compatibility concerns.

3. **Performance Consideration:**
   - Running the `git diff` command relies on the performance of the Git binary and repository size. In large repositories, the process may take noticeable time to complete.

4. **File Output Behavior:**
   - The generated file `diff.txt` is created in the script's working directory. If the file already exists, its content will be overwritten. This behavior should be noted in case the script runs multiple times or concurrently.

== Example Usage

=== Running the Script
To execute the script and generate the Git diff for the last commit, run the following command:

```
python src/scripts/get_diff.py
```

=== Result
- A file, `diff.txt`, is created with the content of the diff for the latest Git commit.
- An example of the console output after running the script:
  ```
  Changes Detected on diff.txt
  ```

=== Example `diff.txt` Content
Assuming the last Git commit contains changes, the `diff.txt` file will have content similar to the following:

```
diff --git a/example.txt b/example.txt
index 1234567..89abcde 100644
--- a/example.txt
+++ b/example.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
-Old line
+New line
 Another unchanged line
```

== Recommendations and Notes
- **Error Handling (Future Enhancement):**
  - Currently, no error handling is implemented for cases like:
      - Non-Git repositories.
      - Failures when running `git diff`.
  - Consider adding checks to handle these scenarios gracefully.
- **Custom Diff Options:**
  - Users might need custom Git diff options. In future updates, allow passing arguments to the `git diff` command.
- **Concurrent Execution:**
  - There is no mechanism to handle concurrent runs of the script that might overwrite the `diff.txt` file. Using unique filenames or temporary directories could mitigate this issue.
